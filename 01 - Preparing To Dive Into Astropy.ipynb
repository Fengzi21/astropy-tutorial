    "\n",
    "If you are using the full Anaconda distribution of Python, it is already available. If you are using an alternate distribution, you can install it by either saying,\n",

    "\n",
    "Astropy is both the Python module as well as the community. And within the community, there exist a lot of other independently made packages. However, these packages strive to be consistent with the overall organizational theme of Astropy. These packages are called the Astropy Affiliated packages.\n",

    "Some of the packages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ccdproc (for CCD data processing)\n",
    "- photutils (for performing photometry using a variety of source detection and photometry algorithms)\n",
    "- specutils (for spectroscopic analyses)\n",
    "- astroquery (for querying commonly used astronomical data archives)\n",

    "\n",
    "In computer programming, we often come across problems or codes where it is needed that we work with objects which are unique in their own way but share common behavior. An effective way to write code where problems can be expressed an object interactions with this kind of behavior is Object Oriented Programming.\n",

    "- the methods or functions that can be performed on these objects.\n",
